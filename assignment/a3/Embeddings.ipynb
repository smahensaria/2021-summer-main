    "\n",
    "To measure the similarity of two words, we'll use the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between their representation vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D^{cos}_{ij} = \\frac{v_i^T v_j}{||v_i||\\ ||v_j||}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "## Part (a) Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `vector_math.py`, implement the `find_nn_cos(...)` function. Read the docstring _carefully_ - it describes what you should return. *Hint: use NumPy functions instead of a `for` loop.*\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "2. Use the `show_nns(...)` function below to find the nearest neighbors for the words `\"bank\"`, `\"plane\"`, and `\"flies\"`. Put the closest word (other than *the exact word* itself) in the answers file.  If you inspect `\"flies\"`, for instance, are the neighbors dominated by one sense of the word or is there evidence that the vector encodes meaning of the other senses as well?\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "3. Like `word2vec`, GloVe constructs representations by summarizing word-word coocurrence statistics. Use `show_nns(...)` to find the neighbors of `\"green\"` and `\"celadon\"`, and `\"orange\"`. Explain what you find in terms of the distributional hypothesis and the grounding problem. Does the vector for `\"celadon\"` appear to encode a notion of color? What do they represent, instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "_(The Distributional Hypothesis is the idea that \"you shall know a word by the company it keeps\" (Firth, 1957) - that meaning is derived from the context in which a word is used. Grounding refers to the meaning of language in terms of external concepts, such as real-world entities or physical characteristics.  Take a look at the readings from the first week if you're not confident.)_\n"
